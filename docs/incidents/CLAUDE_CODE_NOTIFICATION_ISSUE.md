# Claude Code Notification Display Issue

## Summary

The Stata MCP server **IS** correctly sending progress notifications via the MCP protocol, but **Claude Code is NOT displaying them** in its UI. This is a client-side UI issue, not a server-side problem.

## Evidence

### 1. Server is Sending Notifications

From the server logs at `/Users/hanlulong/.vscode/extensions/deepecon.stata-mcp-0.3.4/logs/stata_mcp_server.log`:

```
2025-10-23 11:09:53,315 - sse_starlette.sse - DEBUG - chunk: b'event: message\r\ndata: {"method":"notifications/message","params":{"level":"notice","logger":"stata-mcp","data":"‚è±Ô∏è  20s elapsed / 600s timeout\n\n(üìÅ Inspecting Stata log for new output...)"},"jsonrpc":"2.0"}\r\n\r\n'

2025-10-23 11:09:59,319 - sse_starlette.sse - DEBUG - chunk: b'event: message\r\ndata: {"method":"notifications/message","params":{"level":"notice","logger":"stata-mcp","data":"‚è±Ô∏è  26s elapsed / 600s timeout\n\nüìù Recent output:\nProgress: Completed iteration 20 of  at 11:09:53"},"jsonrpc":"2.0"}\r\n\r\n'

2025-10-23 11:10:05,322 - sse_starlette.sse - DEBUG - chunk: b'event: message\r\ndata: {"method":"notifications/message","params":{"level":"notice","logger":"stata-mcp","data":"‚è±Ô∏è  32s elapsed / 600s timeout\n\nüìù Recent output:\nProgress: Completed iteration 30 of  at 11:10:03"},"jsonrpc":"2.0"}\r\n\r\n'
```

**Notifications sent every 6 seconds during the 70-second execution:**
- ‚è±Ô∏è  14s elapsed
- ‚è±Ô∏è  20s elapsed (with Stata output)
- ‚è±Ô∏è  26s elapsed (with "Progress: Completed iteration 20")
- ‚è±Ô∏è  32s elapsed (with "Progress: Completed iteration 30")
- ‚è±Ô∏è  38s elapsed
- ‚è±Ô∏è  44s elapsed (with "Progress: Completed iteration 40")
- ‚è±Ô∏è  50s elapsed
- ‚è±Ô∏è  56s elapsed (with "Progress: Completed iteration 50")
- ‚è±Ô∏è  62s elapsed (with "Progress: Completed iteration 60")
- ‚è±Ô∏è  68s elapsed
- ‚úÖ Execution completed in 72.0s

### 2. MCP SDK Client CAN See Notifications

When testing with the official MCP Python SDK client (`test_mcp_streamable_client.py`), notifications ARE received and displayed:

```
2025-10-23 09:01:16,202 - mcp.client.streamable_http - DEBUG - SSE message: root=JSONRPCNotification(method='notifications/message', params={'level': 'notice', 'logger': 'stata-mcp', 'data': '‚ñ∂Ô∏è  Starting Stata execution: test_mcp_client.do'}, jsonrpc='2.0')

2025-10-23 09:01:18,203 - mcp.client.streamable_http - DEBUG - SSE message: root=JSONRPCNotification(method='notifications/message', params={'level': 'notice', 'logger': 'stata-mcp', 'data': '‚è±Ô∏è  2s elapsed / 10s timeout\n\n(üìÅ Inspecting Stata log for new output...)'}, jsonrpc='2.0')
```

### 3. Protocol Compliance

The notifications follow the correct MCP protocol format:
- **Method**: `notifications/message` (correct per MCP spec)
- **Params**: `{"level": "notice", "logger": "stata-mcp", "data": "..."}`
- **Transport**: SSE (Server-Sent Events) with proper chunking
- **Event type**: `event: message` (correct for MCP over SSE)

## Root Cause

**Claude Code does not display `notifications/message` in its UI during tool execution.**

Possible reasons:
1. Claude Code's UI may not be designed to show real-time notifications
2. Notifications might be received but buffered until tool execution completes
3. The Claude Code client might only process and display the final `result` response
4. UI design decision to keep the interface clean during execution

## What Works

1. ‚úÖ Server correctly sends notifications via SSE
2. ‚úÖ Official MCP SDK clients can receive and display notifications
3. ‚úÖ Final results are displayed correctly in Claude Code
4. ‚úÖ All MCP protocol standards are being followed

## What Doesn't Work

1. ‚ùå Claude Code UI does not show progress notifications during execution
2. ‚ùå Users cannot see real-time progress updates while tools are running

## Recommendations

### For Stata MCP Server (No Changes Needed)

The server implementation is correct. No changes are required on the server side.

### For Claude Code Users

Currently, there is no workaround. Progress notifications are being sent correctly, but Claude Code's UI simply doesn't display them. You will need to:

1. **Wait patiently** - The tool is still executing, just without visible progress
2. **Check server logs** - You can monitor progress in the server logs if needed:
   ```bash
   tail -f /Users/hanlulong/.vscode/extensions/deepecon.stata-mcp-0.3.4/logs/stata_mcp_server.log
   ```

### For Claude Code Development Team

Consider implementing one of these solutions:

1. **Add a progress indicator** - Show streaming notifications in the UI during tool execution
2. **Add a status line** - Display the most recent notification in a status bar
3. **Add a progress panel** - Create an expandable panel to show execution logs
4. **Add notification badges** - Show a count of unread notifications during execution

## Testing Commands

To verify notifications are being sent:

```bash
# Monitor server logs in real-time
tail -f /Users/hanlulong/.vscode/extensions/deepecon.stata-mcp-0.3.4/logs/stata_mcp_server.log | grep "notifications/message"

# Test with official MCP SDK client (shows notifications work)
.venv/bin/python test_mcp_streamable_client.py
```

## Conclusion

This is **not a bug in the Stata MCP server**. The server is functioning correctly and sending notifications according to the MCP specification. This is a **feature request for Claude Code** to display real-time progress notifications in its UI.
