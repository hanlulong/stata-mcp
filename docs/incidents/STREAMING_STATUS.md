# Stata MCP Streaming Status Report

## Current Status: Streamable HTTP + MCP Streaming ✅

### What's Working ✅
- **HTTP `/run_file` endpoint** – MCP-compatible, returns complete output on completion.
- **HTTP `/run_file/stream` endpoint** – SSE streaming with 2-second updates for direct HTTP clients.
- **MCP Streamable HTTP (`/mcp-streamable`)** – runs via the official `StreamableHTTPSessionManager` and now emits progress logs/progress notifications while `stata_run_file` executes.
- **OpenAPI schema** – exposes `stata_run_file` and `stata_run_selection` with correct operation IDs.

### Streaming Behavior
- The MCP wrapper intercepts `stata_run_file` calls, launches the underlying HTTP request, and polls the Stata log every 10 seconds.
- Progress appears as MCP log messages (with recent output snippets) plus optional `progress` notifications when the client supplies a token. Updates stream immediately through the HTTP transport (SSE mode).
- Completion message is sent on success; errors surface both in logs and via the tool result.

### Notes
- SSE streaming remains available for HTTP clients that connect to `/run_file/stream`.
- Wrapper relies on official transport APIs (`request_context`, `send_log_message`, `send_progress_notification`) and now honours client `logging/setLevel` requests while defaulting to `notice` level for progress updates.

## Files Modified
- `src/stata_mcp_server.py:2826` – reinstated `_execute_api_tool` wrapper to stream progress while still using the official HTTP transport.
