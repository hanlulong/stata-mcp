# Claude Code Notification Issue - Root Cause Analysis

**Date:** October 23, 2025
**Issue:** Claude Code does not display progress notifications during Stata execution
**Status:** üîç **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**

---

## Investigation Summary

###  ‚úÖ What's Working

1. **Server correctly uses HTTP transport:**
   ```
   2025-10-23 19:32:07 - Using HTTP server request context
   2025-10-23 19:32:07 - ‚úì Streaming enabled via HTTP server - Tool: stata_run_file
   ```

2. **Notifications ARE being sent:**
   ```
   2025-10-23 19:32:13 - MCP streaming log [notice]: ‚è±Ô∏è  6s elapsed / 600s timeout
   2025-10-23 19:32:13 - sse_starlette.sse - chunk: event: message
   data: {"method":"notifications/message","params":{"level":"notice","data":"‚è±Ô∏è  6s elapsed..."}}
   ```

3. **26+ notifications sent** during 72-second execution (every 6 seconds)

### ‚ùå What's NOT Working

**Claude Code is not displaying the notifications** - but not because they aren't being sent!

---

## Root Cause

### Issue 1: No Progress Token

Claude Code doesn't provide a `progressToken` in requests:
```
Tool execution - Server: HTTP, Session ID: None, Request ID: 2, Progress Token: None
                                                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

Without a progress token, `send_progress_notification()` returns early and does nothing.

### Issue 2: Claude Code May Not Subscribe to Logging

**Critical Finding:** Claude Code never sends `logging/setLevel` request!

- Server registers the handler: ‚úÖ
  ```
  2025-10-23 19:29:16 - Registering handler for SetLevelRequest
  ```

- Claude Code sends the request: ‚ùå (not found in logs)

**This means Claude Code might not have a logging callback registered to receive notifications!**

---

## Comparison: MCP Python SDK vs Claude Code

### MCP Python SDK (‚úÖ Works)
```python
async def logging_callback(params):
    # Handle notification
    print(f"Notification: {params.data}")

async with ClientSession(
    read_stream,
    write_stream,
    logging_callback=logging_callback  # ‚Üê Explicitly registered
) as session:
    ...
```

**Result:** All 26 notifications received and displayed

### Claude Code (‚ùå Doesn't Work)
- Uses HTTP Streamable transport: ‚úÖ
- Receives SSE stream: ‚úÖ
- Registers logging callback: ‚ùì (unknown - likely ‚ùå)
- Calls `logging/setLevel`: ‚ùå (not in logs)

**Result:** Notifications sent but not displayed

---

## Technical Details

### Notification Flow

1. **Server sends notification:**
   ```python
   await session.send_log_message(
       level="notice",
       data="‚è±Ô∏è  6s elapsed / 600s timeout",
       logger="stata-mcp",
       related_request_id=request_id
   )
   ```

2. **Notification packaged as SSE:**
   ```
   event: message
   data: {"method":"notifications/message","params":{...}}
   ```

3. **Sent via HTTP Streamable transport:**
   ```
   sse_starlette.sse - chunk: b'event: message\r\ndata: {...}\r\n\r\n'
   ```

4. **Client receives SSE event:** ‚úÖ (network layer)

5. **Client processes notification:**  ‚ùå (Claude Code doesn't handle it)

---

## Why Our Fix Worked for Python SDK But Not Claude Code

### Our Fix
```python
# Check HTTP context first (not SSE)
try:
    ctx = http_mcp_server.request_context  # ‚úÖ Now uses HTTP
    server_type = "HTTP"
except (LookupError, NameError):
    # Fall back to SSE
    ctx = bound_self.server.request_context
```

**Effect:**
- ‚úÖ Notifications sent through correct transport (HTTP)
- ‚úÖ MCP Python SDK receives them (has `logging_callback`)
- ‚ùå Claude Code doesn't display them (no `logging_callback`?)

---

## Recommended Solutions

### Option 1: Claude Code Needs to Register Logging Callback

This is a **Claude Code client-side issue**. Claude Code needs to:

1. Register a `logging_callback` when creating the MCP session
2. Optionally send `logging/setLevel` request to enable server-side filtering

**Example fix (in Claude Code's client code):**
```typescript
const session = new Client({
  // ...
  loggingCallback: (params) => {
    // Display notification in UI
    showNotification(params.level, params.data);
  }
});
```

### Option 2: Use Progress Notifications Instead

If Claude Code properly handles progress notifications, we could switch to those:

**Server-side change:**
```python
if progress_token:
    await session.send_progress_notification(
        progress_token=progress_token,
        progress=elapsed,
        total=timeout
    )
```

**But:** Claude Code doesn't send `progressToken`, so this won't work either.

### Option 3: Report to Anthropic

This appears to be a **Claude Code bug** - the client should either:
1. Register a logging callback, OR
2. Provide a progress token

Without either, real-time notifications can't work.

## Testing Evidence

### Server Logs Prove Notifications Are Sent

```
2025-10-23 19:32:07 - MCP streaming log: ‚ñ∂Ô∏è  Starting Stata execution
2025-10-23 19:32:13 - MCP streaming log: ‚è±Ô∏è  6s elapsed / 600s timeout
2025-10-23 19:32:19 - MCP streaming log: ‚è±Ô∏è  12s elapsed / 600s timeout
... (26 total notifications)
2025-10-23 19:33:19 - MCP streaming log: ‚úÖ Execution completed in 72.0s
```

All sent via SSE chunks:
```
sse_starlette.sse - chunk: b'event: message\r\ndata: {"method":"notifications/message",...
```

### MCP Python SDK Test Proves They Can Be Received

```
$ python test_mcp_client_notifications.py

üì¢ [0.0s] Log [notice]: ‚ñ∂Ô∏è  Starting Stata execution
üì¢ [2.0s] Log [notice]: ‚è±Ô∏è  2s elapsed / 90s timeout
... (26 notifications)
üì¢ [72.1s] Log [notice]: ‚úÖ Execution completed

‚úÖ SUCCESS: Notifications were received by the MCP client!
   Total: 26 notifications
```

## Conclusion

**The server is working correctly.** Our fix ensures notifications are sent through the HTTP transport, and they ARE being sent. The MCP Python SDK proves they can be received.

**The issue is in Claude Code's client implementation.** Claude Code either:
1. Doesn't register a logging callback to receive notifications, OR
2. Registers one but has a bug preventing display

**Action Items:**

1. ‚úÖ **Server-side:** Fixed and verified
2. ‚ùå **Client-side:** Needs fix in Claude Code
3. üìù **Report to Anthropic:** File bug report about missing notification support

**Workaround:** Until Claude Code is fixed, users can:
- Monitor the log file directly
- Use the web UI data viewer (if available)
- Check Stata's own log files
